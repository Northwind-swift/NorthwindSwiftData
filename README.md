</h2>

Note: SwiftData requires Xcode 15b+ and iOS 17/macOS 14.

[SwiftData](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftdata/) 
version of Microsoft's Northwind Database,
filled from 
[NorthwindSQLite.swift](https://github.com/Northwind-swift/NorthwindSQLite.swift),
which is a packaged version of 
[Northwind-SQLite3](https://github.com/jpwhite3/northwind-SQLite3)
by @jpwhite3.

From Northwind-SQLite3:
> The Northwind sample database was provided with Microsoft Access as a tutorial
> schema for managing 
> small business customers, orders, inventory, purchasing, suppliers, shipping,
> and employees. 
> Northwind is an excellent tutorial schema for a small-business ERP, with
> customers, orders, inventory, 
> purchasing, suppliers, shipping, employees, and single-entry accounting.

It can be useful in the SwiftData context to play with SwiftData, as it provides
a pre-filled database and a set of models.
The database is a little old, but still useful to get started w/ an actual 
dataset.

### Using it in a SwiftUI app

1. Create a SwiftUI app in Xcode
2. Add NorthwindSwiftData as a dependency, the url is:
   `https://github.com/Northwind-swift/NorthwindSwiftData.git`
3. Setup the model container for the UI:

```swift
@main
struct NorthwindApp: App {

  var body: some Scene {
    WindowGroup {
      ContentView()
    }
    .modelContainer(try! NorthwindStore.modelContainer())
  }
}
```

That's it. It will copy the included database to the application support
directory of the application and setup everything else.

The other option is to use `.readOnlyModelContainer()` which will return a
container that directly accesses the embedded database.
Can be useful for tests and the like.

### Creating the Database

The package includes a filled Northwind database created from the data provided in
[Northwind-SQLite3](https://github.com/jpwhite3/northwind-SQLite3).
It is imported using
[NorthwindSQLite.swift](https://github.com/Lighter-swift/NorthwindSQLite.swift)
by a separate
[Importer Tool](https://github.com/Northwind-swift/SwiftDataImporter.git).

Note: The import takes hours to run ‚è≥


### Bugs

The SQLite version of Northwind has a few bugs, mostly related to optionality
(i.e. a lot of columns are marked as NULLable which likely shouldn't be).
The goal is to fix those in the SwiftData model & import, PRs are welcome.
Though it shouldn't be overly non-null, even if fields are never set to
NULL in the DB (e.g. address fields).
